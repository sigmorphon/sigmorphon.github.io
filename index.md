Welcome to the home page of the ACL Special Interest Group on Computational Morphology and Phonology (SIGMORPHON). We are a forum for exchanging news of recent research developments and other matters of interest in computational morphology and phonology.

**Workshops:** SIGMORPHON also organizes in computational morphology and phonology. The next meeting will be the 19th SIGMORPHON Workshop, which will take place at NAACL 2023 in Toronto, Canada, in July, 2023.

**Shared tasks:** SIGMORPHON is hosting two shared tasks: inflectional morphology and automatic glossing. They will be presented during the workshop at ACL 2023.  Please check the 2023 webpage for links and details.
