**Workshops:** SIGMORPHON also organizes [workshops]({{ "/workshops" | absolute_url }}) in computational morphology and phonology. The next meeting will be the [19th SIGMORPHON Workshop]({{ "/workshops/2022" | absolute_url }}), which will take place at ACL 2022 in Seattle, USA, in July, 2022.

**Shared tasks:** SIGMORPHON is organizing the several shared tasks on phonology and morphology. It will be presented during NAACL 2022.  Please check the 2022 webpage for links and details.
